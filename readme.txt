NetBible Tagger 

== Description ==

NETBibleTagger is an innovative way to quote and link to the Bible from your existing scripture references. Plain references turn into hyperlinks which create a small in-line windows (tooltips), when the user mouses over them. This tooltip displays the text in the passage(s) that were referenced. A "Read more" link is provided allowing one to view in context the reference and to study it further in the free NET ® Bible Study Environment! Now, you have access to the same great Bible quoting that Bible.org has been using for years to enhance its readers' experiences. The Translation used is the NET ®. You can find out more about it here; And here is a comparison of the NET with the NIV and ESV.

NETBibleTagger makes citing Bible references easier than ever. Simply copy the html code below and paste it into your site's template file(s). Whether you have one web page on your site or thousands, NETBibleTagger will instantly transform all current and future links, saving you the countless hours it would take to manually tag all of your verses. Should you ever decide to remove NETBibleTagger, you only have to remove the couple of lines you copied to your template files(s). There are no residual affects left behind. This is because NETBibleTagger uses Javascript and actually inserts the links after your users have downloaded the page.

NETBibleTagger supports all of the Bible book names and their standard abbreviations. It will recognize and tag books with only one chapter (e.g., Matthew 1 or Matthew 2:9). It also handles multiple verses and chapters in a row with verses separated by commas and chapter:verse groups separated by semi-colons (e.g., Acts 3:16-18; 4:2-4), and recognizes many other common abbreviations and formats (e.g., Lk 2:1; 4:4; Gal 3:3; 3:8-10; Eph 3:1; 4:2). Whether you use a hyphen (-) or an en dash (–), NETBibleTagger will correctly recognize and tag your Bible references (e.g., Rom 5:1-10; Eph 2:8–9).

To prevent certain verses from being linked, place the text you want NETBibleTagger to ignore inside of <cite></cite> tags. == Installation ==
